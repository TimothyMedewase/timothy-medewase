              I am software engineer with a background in Computer science and
              Mathematics. I am currently pursuing a Bachelors degree in
              computer science with a mathematics minor at the University of
              Montevallo, Alabama. I am also very interested in Machine learning
              and Artificial intelligence.
              <br />
              <br />
              Over the past years, I have been very much involved in Mathematics
              and Sciences and mostly been interested in the intersection
              between Chemistry and Mathematics. I have competed in several
              mathematics competion like the AMC 8, 10, 12, South African
              Mathematics Olympiad, Kangourou sans fronti√®res maths competion
              and many more, and I have bagged a couple medals in them. Also, I
              competed in various chemistry competions like the Nigerian
              Chemistry Olympiad ranking in the top 10 in the country and top 3
              in my state.
              <br />
              <br />
              My passion for both Mathematics and Chemistry has led to me
              aspiring for a future where machine learning and artificial
              intelligence models can be used to solve complex problems
              particularly, in the field of Chemistry.
