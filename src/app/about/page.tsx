                  I am software engineer with a strong foundation in Computer
                  science and Mathematics, currently pursuing a bachelors degree
                  in computer science with a minor in mathematics at the
                  University of Montevallo, Alabama. I am also very interested
                  in Machine learning and Artificial intelligence.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Over the years, I have been actively involved in mathematics
                  and sciences, especially drawn to the intersection of
                  chemistry and mathematics. I have participated in several
                  mathematics competitions, including the AMC 8, 10, and 12, the
                  South African Mathematics Olympiad, and the Kangourou sans
                  fronti√®res, earning multiple medals. In addition, I competed
                  in various chemistry competitions, such as the Nigerian
                  Chemistry Olympiad, where I ranked in the top 10 nationally
                  and in the top 3 in my state.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My passion for both Mathematics and Chemistry has led to me
                  aspiring for a future where machine learning and artificial
                  intelligence models can be used to solve complex problems
                  particularly, in the field of Chemistry. Also, I am very
                  interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
                  Reinforcement Learning through deep learning models.
