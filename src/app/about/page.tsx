                  I am software engineer with a background in Computer science
                  and Mathematics. I am currently pursuing a Bachelors degree in
                  computer science with a mathematics minor at the University of
                  Montevallo, Alabama. I am also very interested in Machine
                  learning and Artificial intelligence.

                <p className="mb-4">
                  Over the past years, I have been very much involved in
                  Mathematics and Sciences and mostly been interested in the
                  intersection between Chemistry and Mathematics. I have
                  competed in several mathematics competion like the AMC 8, 10,
                  12, South African Mathematics Olympiad, Kangourou sans
                  fronti√®res maths competion and many more, and I have bagged a
                  couple medals in them. Also, I competed in various chemistry
                  competions like the Nigerian Chemistry Olympiad ranking in the
                  top 10 in the country and top 3 in my state.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My passion for both Mathematics and Chemistry has led to me
                  aspiring for a future where machine learning and artificial
                  intelligence models can be used to solve complex problems
                  particularly, in the field of Chemistry.
